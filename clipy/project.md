# Project Notes

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED:CORE_START -->
## Core App Snapshot (Auto)
- Last updated: 2026-04-23 14:05 UTC
- App: Clipy
- Slug: clipy
- Tagline: Fast social-ready video edits and GIF exports in seconds.
- Target users: Content creators, TikTok/Reels users, meme makers, casual users needing fast video editing
- Design direction: Refine the existing editor into a darker, tighter, CapCut-inspired composition while preserving the app's current Material 3 foundation: a dominant media preview on top, a compact control rail, and a high-clarity timeline dock with strong selection contrast, precise trim affordances, and smooth motion feedback. Emphasize density, alignment, and immediate manipulation rather than decorative changes.
- Core constraints: Android only, no backend, lightweight but powerful, limit GIF size/duration, smooth UX, handle large videos safely
Design style must align with: Modern dark creator-tool UI, clean layout, smooth animations, rounded cards, premium feel
Typography should align with: Inter
Feature priorities: Pick video, preview playback, trim start/end, crop ratios 1:1 4:5 9:16 16:9, change speed, mute audio, export GIF, export MP4, adjust GIF fps/resolution, adjust MP4 quality, reverse, boomerang, add text watermark, rename output, save, share, export progress, export history
Must-have requirements: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM, Media3 ExoPlayer, FFmpeg processing, Room database, DataStore, proper content URI handling, optimized performance
Use Android applicationId/package name: com.nantcompany.clipy
Feature priorities update: Add draggable trim timeline like CapCut with thumbnail preview, start/end handles, playhead, and real-time synced video preview
Feature priorities update: Add a CapCut-style timeline editor with draggable start and end handles, thumbnail preview strip, movable playhead, and real-time synced video preview. Continue refining UX, gestures, and animations until the interaction feels as smooth and responsive as CapCut timeline editing.
Feature priorities update: Implement a CapCut-style timeline editor with pinch-to-zoom, smooth draggable scrolling, draggable start/end trim handles, frame-by-frame stepping, snap-to-keyframe cutting, looping preview for selected range, real-time synced video preview via ExoPlayer seek, and optimized thumbnail caching/lazy loading for ultra-smooth performance
Feature priorities update: Implement the basic MVP first: pick video from gallery, preview video playback, draggable start and end trim selection, real-time synced preview while trimming, export as short MP4, export as GIF, save output to device, share exported file, simple export progress UI, and basic export history
Feature priorities update: Add basic crop ratio presets for 1:1, 4:5, 9:16, and 16:9 so users can export clips for different social platforms
Additional follow-up requirement: Add mute toggle so users can choose whether exported MP4 keeps or removes original audio
Feature priorities update: Redesign the video editor UI and timeline to closely match CapCut style: large video preview on top, thumbnail timeline strip below, draggable start and end trim handles, central playhead, smooth horizontal scrolling, pinch-to-zoom timeline, dimmed unselected areas, highlighted selected range, real-time synced preview while dragging, looping preview for selected segment, and polished animations until the interaction feels as smooth and responsive as CapCut
Additional follow-up requirement: [fixbug] Fix the editor UI because it does not match CapCut style and the timeline feels laggy when swiping. Redesign the layout to look closer to CapCut with a cleaner preview area, thumbnail strip, selected range highlight, draggable trim handles, and central playhead. Optimize timeline rendering, gesture handling, thumbnail caching, lazy loading, and preview sync so horizontal swiping becomes smooth, responsive, and stable like CapCut.
